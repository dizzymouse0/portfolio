## Project description: 
To refactor html and css into a more concise and semantic styling along with adding accessibility attributes to reach a wider audience and improve compliance. Completed by assigning semantic elements in standardized fashion and adding alt tags to images.

### Why I want to learn how to program.
    I've always enjoyed my time on the computer, either by gaming, designing, or even building PC's themselves; it's always fascinated me. I'm beginning to understand how computer languages work, and I look forward to continuing my journey toward becoming a better coder.
