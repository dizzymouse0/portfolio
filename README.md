## Project description: 
To refactor html and css into a more concise and semantic styling along with adding accessibility attributes to reach a wider audience and improve compliance. Completed by assigning semantic elements in standardized fashion and adding alt tags to images.

### Why add accessibility?
    Adding accessibility features to a webpage not only improves the web experience for individuals 
    who use page readers, it also benefits others by improving search engine results and site rating.
